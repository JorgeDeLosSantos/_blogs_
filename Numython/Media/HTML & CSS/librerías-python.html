							<li>a powerful N-dimensional array object</li>
							<li>sophisticated (broadcasting) functions</li>
							<li>tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code</li>
							<li>useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities</li>
						</ul>
						Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

						Numpy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions.
